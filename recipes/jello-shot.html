        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>I had to make hundreds of Jell-O® shots for a wedding, so I decided to have fun with them and try out some new mixes. This was my margarita-flavored shot, a bit strong but good if you want variety with your selection. If you want them more palatable, substitute water for a bit of the alcohol. </p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package lime-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-O®)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup tequila</li>
            <li>⅓ cup triple sec</li>
            <li>⅓ cup water</li>
            <li>15 plastic shot glasses, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine boiling water and gelatin mix in a bowl. Stir to dissolve. Add tequila, triple sec, and water. Stir again.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture into shot glasses. Refrigerate until set, about 5 hours.</li>
        </ol>
